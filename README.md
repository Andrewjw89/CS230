•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was The Gaming Room, and they wanted to expand their Android based game, ‘Draw It or Lose It’, from a single platform to a web-based game accessible on multiple platforms.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I did particularly well on identifying potential design constraints. Being able to identify any potential constraints prior to development 
can help to catch issues that may delay the progress of development later.

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through a design document is an excellent way to plan the development process because it allowed me to clearly define the client’s software 
requirements and anticipate potential challenges that might arise during development. It will also be useful as a reference point for tracking development progress.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise my description of the domain model to make it more concise, as clarity and brevity are crucial in a design document. I feel as though I over explained
the domain model being represented in the design document. Being concise helps prevent misinterpretations and ensures that all team members and the client clearly understand the plan.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I took into consideration the user’s needs by analyzing The Gaming Room’s requirements such as cross-platform accessibility, the need for unique team and game names,
and the necessity of maintaining a single instance of the game in memory. This was done by using a client-server architecture model and by using techniques such as the 
singleton design pattern. Its important to always consider the user's needs during software design because doing so directly affects user satisfaction and helps prevent 
potential issues that could arise from misunderstandings during the development process. Misunderstanding the user's requirements late in the development process can lead 
to a significant loss of time and money.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached the designing of software by first developing a clear summary and list of The Gaming Room’s requirements. This is to ensure that anyone reading the software 
design document has a clear understanding of the project’s objectives from the very start. Potential design constraints were then addressed to ensure that any possible issues
are addressed prior to development like the use of the singleton instance to manage game instances and the iterator pattern to ensure unique names. In the future, I will continue
to use techniques such as clearly listing user requirements and identifying any potential design constraints that the project may have to help mitigate issues and ensure a
smoother development process. This will allow me to better anticipate potential challenges, make educated design decisions, and help deliver a final product that aligns with
the user's needs and expectations.
